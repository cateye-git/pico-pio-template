# pico-pio-template

A minimal PIO-based project for the RPi Pico (RP2040).
The comments may be slightly easier to follow than those in `pico-examples/pio`.

> **Important:** requires the build environment from the new RPi Windows installer and the new PicoProbe firmware that supports `cmsis-dap.cfg`
